#  Scrumdinger

## Introduction

Scrumdinger is an example iOS app provided in [Apple's iOS App Dev Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger).

After finishing the tutorial, I am able to manage scrums in different teams, each team has different title, duration, theme color, and participants. When a scrum meeting begins, each participant has a certain timeframe to speak. During speaking, speech recognition is used to transcribe. When the time for the current speaker is up, a "ding" sound is played and a segment is added to the ring. When the meeting is done, a history is stored using JSON serialization.
